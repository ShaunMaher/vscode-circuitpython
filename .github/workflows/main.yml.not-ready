# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request 
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master, test-actions ]
#  pull_request:
#    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # Get modules, rebuild for each platform
